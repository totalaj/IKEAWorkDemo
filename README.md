# IKEAWorkDemo

## Installation:

Run `npm install`

Compile using `npm run build` or whatever your IDE has, as long as its using webpack

I launch using (Live Server)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer], but something like webpack dev server should also work

## Controls

LMB to rotate
RMB to pan around
MouseWheel to zoom
